# 732A74-Introduction to Python


# Lab 1
This Assignment is about **python Basic Operation** Such as: 

* String manuplation.
* Iteration, sequences and string formatting.
* Dictionaries(create,Edit,Delete)
* Functions and conditionals.
* File I/O Operations(read a data from file and store a data in a file after processing).


# Lab 2A
This Assignment is about Programming Paradigms in Python - **Functional Programming**

* Recursion(we have given a Iterative vereion of function, we have to conver it into Recursive version).
* Higher-order functions and anonymous functions
* Comprehensions
* Building your own higher order functions such as (Map, Filter, Reduce).
* The pipeline function.
* Closures, returning functions with state.
* Practical applications: Quicksort (Implementation of QuickSort function,Quicksort as a higher order function with know arguments and Quicksort as a higher order function with unknown arguments).


# Lab 2B
This Assignment is about Programming Paradigms in Python - **Object-oriented Programming**.
* Implementaion of Classes and their member function.
* Private and Public class Methods.
* Implementation of parameterized constructor.
* Implementation of  default constructor.


# Lab 3
This Assignment is about **Data Science in Python** which include, work with the Boston house price dataset. The dataset is available through SciKit-learn. Import the dataset and print its description. Then create a pandas DataFrame containing all 14 attributes in the dataset.

* Implementation of Implementing OLS Regression
* Cross Validation and plotting(Implement a function **cross_validate** in the OLS class which should take one parameter, n, and perform n-fold cross-validation on the data supplied at creation of an OLS object.Use **matplotlib** and plot the result).
* Explore SciKit-learn and select 3 regression algorithms(I implemented Ridge Regression, Lasso and Multi-layer Perceptron regressor and plot the result).
